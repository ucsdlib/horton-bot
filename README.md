A happy and wise Slack-bot for the UCSD Library, or so we've been told.

## What can it do?

### Events
1. The bot will post to the `#general` channel when a new channel is created.
1. The bot will welcome a new user to the team with a customized welcome message

### Commands
1. `hours` - responds with Library building(s) hours for the day

In time, assuming interest, additional bot-like features will be added.
